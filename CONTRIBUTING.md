# Contributing to base64id
First of all, thank you for looking to contribute to my project!

This is my first ever open source project and I would be humbled to receive your contribution.

## My Personal Commitment
As my time to work on this project is limited, been split between my day job and other development projects, I expect to be able to work on this project for 1 to 2 hours a week.

My main goal is to get this project into a state where it is *done*, where no further significant work is required, beyond occasional maintenance work (version bumps for dependencies).

At my discretion I may spend additional time to wrap up any bugs or security issues depending on severity.

## Where to Contribute
Contribution in the form of suggestions, feedback and bug reports are welcome via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/shauncksm/base64id-rs/issues).

Additionally, pull requests are welcome for

- bug fixes
- documentation improvements (Including rustdoc sections and files in the `examples` directory)
- benchmarking code improvements (within the `benches` directory)

For feature requests, please see [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the overall direction I wish for this project to take.

If your feature is not within scope I would encourage you to create a fork of this project.
